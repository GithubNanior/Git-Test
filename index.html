            <h2>The paradox of expectations</h2>

            <p>
                Let's discuss the deal with expections here, or rather, that
                you expect upon reading the title expect that I'm seriously
                going to discuss
                What, you thought that you'd meet a programmer with <strong>gorilla</strong>-like body build wearing a friggin <strong>tank top</strong>??
                <br>
                Well... Too bad, I got a few deformations for the trade instead, git gud.

            <h2>Where you belong in this world</h2>
            
            <p>
            To belong, or not to belong, this is an intricate question that only idiots ask, if you don't feel at home, then you don't belong, it's that simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                I make games, but not as impressive as many games on the market... Although as a person or rather, as a friend, I may have my fair share to offer.
                <br>
                I like kinda anything that conveys a world, different lifes, creatures, plants, the beauty of carving a world... Does that interest you?
                <br>
                So like, do you wish to stay, or do you not? It's all up to you.
